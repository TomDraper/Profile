            <p>This was completed for a friend who I've worked with on projects in the past, with this being the most recent. It was completed on a very strict schedule (he needed it completed for 9am and came to me for help late in the day), and so we worked together with me editing and him giving real-time feedback to get it completed with the "90's VHS" look that he desired.</p>

            <h2>Portal Trailer</h2>
            <p>during my time as a carer, I assisted a service user with a YouTube series about Portal that he wanted to make. This was the video that I got the most creative control over. I created the 3D model at the beginning as well as the end-cards (using the creator's directions), as well as editing and timing all cuts. The voice is not mine.</p>

            <h2>Portal Series</h2>
            <p>I created many control schemes for the series (as well as a pipeline for the future) as can be seen

            <p>Click above image to link to the full playlist. Most of the videos are largely unedited, I mostly just polished it by cutting out any coughs/misspeaks. It was very important to the creator that every control scheme should be displayed, and that's where I spent the most time.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we did record other gameplay including older Nintendo and Sega games, which required the use of capture cards and different setups. To make it user-friendly for the creator I used HDMI splitters (and various cables) to provide him easy switches to a number of different IOs</p>
