            <p>A long time friend we have worked on projects in the past together, with this being the most recent. He came to me late in the day and told me he needed it done by 9am, we stayed up all night with him giving me feedback while I showed him various effects to create a "90s VHS look" that he wanted.</p>

            <h2>Portal Trailer</h2>
            <p>The video I got the most creative control over in the Portal Series I edited during my time at Angard Staffing as a Carer. Part of a full Youtube series I created the 3D model at the beginning as well as the end cards (Using the creators art directions), edited and timed all cuts etc. The voice is not mine.</p>

            <h2>Portal Series</h2>
            <p>Created many control schemes for the series (As well as a pipeline for the future) as can be seen

            <p>Click above image to link to the full playlist. Most videos are unedited in nature, just cut out any coughs or misspeakings. However it was very important to him that every control scheme feasible be displayed so that took up a lot of time.</p>
            <p>As well as this we recorded far more than just Portal, including very old Nintendo games and Sega games requiring capture cards and various setups. To this end I used some HDMI Splitters and various cables to provide him easy switches to a number of different IOs.</p>
