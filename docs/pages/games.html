        <h1>Games</h1>
        <p>Games and game design is really where my passion lies. I began at Teesside
          University with Unreal Engine and blueprints and have since progressed into learning
          Unity. This is where I feel most comfortable, preferably working with C# however have
          used javascript (unityscript) for certain instances and as personal challenges. While I
          mostly work in 2D to create my own assets easily/quickly I have done 3D physics/games with stock unity assets
          and would feel comfortable dealing with both physics types.

        <h1>50/50</h1>
        <p class = "regular">This is a text based game that I am extremely excited for. You begin a
          fictional life in the present day on a world similar to ours choosing how to
          structure your character skills; Fitness, Intellect, Temperment, Creativity, Attractiveness, Charisma.
          From that point you will then be given certain 'events' that occur in your life occasionally.
          Every time this happens you will be given one of two ways to react, hence the name fifty-fifty. However
          the events the character can receive, the actions they can perform and the rewards they gain are dependent on their current situation. So if the player
          has a low temperment they might get into more fights, or if they have a high attractiveness they
          have a better chance in finding a partner. While somewhat random the game allows the players the feeling
          of control in this way encouraging replayability and with an emphasis on easy and fast expansion the code is simple to understand
          and could be improved to support mods or expansion packs with relative ease.

        <h1>Score Attack</h1>
        <p class = "regular">A fast-paced game designed for Android phones. I mainly used this as a practice build for supporting
          sprite sizes across multiple devices after a few less than displayable efforts but thought the
          key concept was solid enough to include support for the quick addition of levels by changing the scoring values, adding possible sprites to a list and changing
          the theme on a scene by scene basis allowing 'zones' and player progression. The plan would then be to add in power ups such as 'Constant Positive Numbers'. It also
          is in no way efficient. I got stuck trying loads of graphics and lost interest. However looking back it is easy to see how I would go about continuing the project.
