          <h2>General Concept:</h2>
          <p>
            Generate interesting base terrain that can be highly modifiable for multiple use cases. This terrain could later be used as the base for a structured level or for further generation of procedural elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was done as an introduction to ECS for myself and I was more interested in working with the ECS system and discovering ways I could use it and implement it into future projects. As such the actual core code of this project is very simple; simple pathfinding, spawning of pawns, and the 'landing' of a 'Ruler' is all it does.

            <h2>Perlin Noise:</h2>
            <p>
              I love perlin noise. These are just screenshots of a 2D heightmap generated based on the parameters put in. Most interesting is probably the shader that blends the colours between heights allowing seperation of sea, sand, land, mountain, or any other type of land.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a Ruler that chooses a nearby node and lands there, plants their flag and then begins collecting resources from nodes. All of this is occuring off screen in the Entity Debugger.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project is incredibly unimpressive for what I could achieve with the knowledge I have now, but it did form as a brilliant introduction to ECS and how to think of Systems vs Objects and the different approaches you must take for each.

            <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
            The terrain itself would look a lot better with just a simple water plane and skybox. I think if I were to continue this project the focus would certainly be on the terrain more than creating entities and systems you cannot see.
          </p>
            <p>
              To that end if I were to continue the terrain generation I would add biomes by using a seperate heightmap overlayed, include some sort of object pass in the generation to provide trees, rocks, etc. I would also code in something to walk around rather than static cameras which is what it is now.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if I were to continue it really far adding elements such as an erosion simulation, temperature map, pressure map or flooding could also help to push the model to higher levels of realism. That being said I'm pretty sure in doing so you would lose a lot of the benefits of the ECS architecture, namely; speed.
