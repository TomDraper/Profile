        <h2>Tools I regularly use:</h2>
        <p><b>Godot</b> is an open-source games engine, mainly aimed at 2D sprite based games but does include capabilities for 3D. I've recently switched to this being my engine of choice (over Unity) due to its "tool" keyword, a workflow more suited to individuals, and a more intuitive UI system that in my opinion handles multiple resolutions easier.</p>
        <p><b>Unity</b> and <b>Unreal Engine</b> were taught to me at University. The former of which I have continued to expand my learning on including creation of Editor GUI Tools, custom component systems and utilizing the ECS system when that was introduced. It is by far the engine I have the most experience with.</p>
        <p>I use <b>Blendr</b> for when I need 3D models, <b>Krita</b> for digital painting and manipulation, <b>Graphics Gale</b> for 2D sprite creation / animation, and <b>Inkscape</b> for vector drawing. These are all free or open source versions of popular software I have used in the past; Photoshop, Illustrator, 3DS Max, Maya etc.

            <h2>Unity - Fifty Fifty</h2>
            <p>I had an interesting concept for how a text adventure could be created to create multiple and dynamic storylines procedurally. The main bulk of which would be with creating large amounts of characters, places, and events for the player and then depending on what choices the player made having those characters/worlds seemingly 'know' of the players choice by limiting the selection pool of possible events.</p>
