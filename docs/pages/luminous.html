Worked in the 'Core' team where I helped design, implement and deploy the tools that developers would use to create these scenarios quicker and to a better standard than before.</p>

          <h2>Overview:</h2>
          <p>
             I initially helped out with creation of modules but was quickly moved to the 'Core' team where we would design systems and tools for the development team so they could create modules quickr, to the same or better standard. This also included fixing some long standing bugs and issues with the codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as developing tools to speed up the established development process I also designed and wrote several new systems including automatic Localization, a Desktop Controller compatible with VR, moving our networking solution from Photon PUN to Photon Fusion and AR development for the iPad.

            <h2>Localization:</h2>
            <p>
              One of my first major projects was to design an automated localization system that integrated with their predefined systems. Namely the 'Flow' system they had which is a visual scripting language specifically designed for their work.
            </p>
            <p> 
                This was a challenge to begin with and took me some time to perfect, but by the end we could localize any module or scene using Google Translate API, had the ability to do this for any language the API would support (Around 200). In addition to translating the text it also produced Text-To-Speech (TTS) audio files for each translation.                  
            </p>
            <p>
                Voices could be swapped out with relative ease. New languages and new voices could also be added with ease. At its most for one module I believe we supported 12 languages, with a few thousand audio clips and text translated.

            <h2>Desktop Controller:</h2>
                <p>
                    When I first got there the only way to play through any module was to do so in VR. Which made a lot of sense as they were a VR company but when a client asked if they could have a desktop version it fell to me to design this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The controller I ended up making was something entirely different from any Player Controller I had made before, this was because the controller had to use the VR systems they were already using, some of which it 'piggybacked' on quite happily and others were more troublesome.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually I created the controller as well as a full pause/settings menu where it could be personalized to the users taste and it became the defacto testing version as it was far faster to develop with than with the VR headsets. (VR was of course still tested for)

            <h2>PUN to Fusion:</h2>

              <p>
                  One of the tasks I got was to transfer our entire networking solution (Photon PUN) to a newer version (Photon Fusion). This was an incredibly arduous task as the networking solution had become deeply embedded within the project and basically ran everything. Without it most things broke.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Eventually I ended up rewriting a lot of the underlying systems and got rid of a lot more that were no longer needed or unfit for purpose. Ending up with a sleeker design that was built with Fusion in mind from the start.

            <h2>AR iPad - MR Meta Quest 3</h2>

            <p>Having never worked with Apple products in a professional environment and not for many years I was a little concerned about this task but ultimately wasn't as painful as I was expecting it to be.</p>
              
              <p> The client wanted an AR representation of their workplace and the area around it developed where the user could use an iPad to navigate around and displaying a brief history of the place as the user went through. </p>
              
              <p>Because it was in AR the user could get incredibly close to buildings, but the actual place was massive. As such we had to think carefully about LODs as well as other performance saving tricks we could implement. In addition to this the dev work involved combining and smoothly transitioning between multiple animations around the island.</p>
              
              <p>On top of the task as well it was necessary that I communicated and effectively got the team 'up to speed' with Apple development pipeline as I myself was learning it from (relative) scratch. We also made essentially the same app using the Meta Quest 3 MR capabilities, but this was already in our wheelhouse so I wasn't massively concerned or troubled by this.</p>
