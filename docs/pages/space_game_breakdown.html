          <h2>Overview and Goals:</h2>
          <p>
            The goal was to create a simple system to organise spawning of assets so that the designer can quickly understand what is happening in a scene, as well as be able to change up timings, sound effects, etc. without digging through resource files or spending time finding correct files within the file explorer.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this goal in mind I set up a very simple player which rotates when still and the player can click to add a linear velocity in the direction it faces. They exist surrounded by collision boxes that reflect their velocity back (bounce-off the walls), and spawners are added above the scene with timings specified as they are needed.

            <h2>Player Character:</h2>
            <p>
              The player character is the simplest object. The player can stop and start movement, the character points in a direction and will go in that direction. There is some lerping between a max rotation and speed and it has a signal (Godot's version of a callback), to reflect its velocity when it hits a wall.

            <h2>Spawners:</h2>
            <p>Spawners were the main goal of the project for me and were ideally what I wanted to get into. Here is the current version of that. It features an in-editor display to quickly read information about a spawner as well as preview individual spawners.</p>
            <p>
              I've added some basic variables the designer is likely to want to use further down production. Things such as colors of objects, audio effects library to use, as well as random parameters for if the user wishes to create endless levels or random elements within structured levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most important piece of note however is that these spawners have a begin_time variable which dictates when they should start -- RELATIVE TO THEIR SCENE. With this in mind we can then stack spawners on top of each other; creating essentially 'prefab' spawner scenes.

            <h2>Sequences:</h2>

            <p>The point of creating things this way was to create sequences. These prefabbed spawns have times relative to a parent and as such can be given their own begin_time relative to <b>their</b> scene. In the end the scene is saved and can either be used as a prefabbed scene itself or be used as a full level.</p>
            <p>
              The advantages of doing it this way is that I can control the amount of information shown to the designer, I can make specific changes to the local file to make broad changes to all spawners or alternatively make specific changes to the level file to get wildly different results. Because of how the spawners are set up I can also spawn in just about any scene I wish as long as it has a "SpawnableObject" script on it.

            <h2>Next Steps:</h2>

            <p>I am currently working on a way to condense several of these spawner files into one resource that can be loaded into each level, currently if the designer imports the sequence above it would show 3 spawners. I want one spawner with variables to change all children.</p>
            <p>Currently spawners have instanced resource files on them, which makes them unique to each one. This is fine for editing levels because things change regularly however they currently only exist in the memory of the editor and would be incorrectly exported for release. This is simple to fix (providing you know it's going to be a problem) and is actually key to my design as I plan to export the previously mentioned sequences <b>only</b>, the spawners are just for the designers. This saves the eventual file size of the game and prevents the file system getting overloaded with minorly changed files (Tree0001.tscn, Tree0002.tscn...).
