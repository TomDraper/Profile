          <h2>Overview:</h2>
          <p>
             A briliant start into the industry where I learnt Unreal and C++ having come from Unity and C#. Was quickly moved up from a junior developer to a developer where I worked for some major clients and was part of the main development team.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Sprung I learnt perforce, as well as how to write C++ code using Unreal Engine and was meticulous in how we created designs so that they would scale to different resolutions, adapt to changes without compromising performance, follow designs to pixel perfect standards and keep going as a team. Sadly due to the necessity that we move to Brighton I eventually had to make the decision to not move as we were planning for children and it would have isolated my Wife. This was a very difficult decision to make, but ultimately I think was the right choice for me, however hard it was to leave the company.

            <h2>Unity to Unreal Transition:</h2>
            <p>
              While I had played around with Unreal before, mainly using blueprints and the smallest of scripts I had used Unity for many years and was very used to that process. When I first came to Sprung I was told to learn Unreal as a part of a Junior Development team. I had to relearn a lot of things and getting used to pointers and memory allocation and similar was a difficult shift in thinking, but I was surrounded by extremely talented people who were very helpful and informative. With their help and backing I quickly got used to working with Unreal and very quickly was building full fledged UIs.
            </p>
              <p>
                  Part of the reason I got moved up so quickly was that this transition happened very quickly and they effectively ended my junior 'internship' early so that I could work for a major client and was placed in a developer role there. I was overjoyed at this change and worked my heart out while I was there.

            <h2>UI Design:</h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the principles that people at Sprung embedded in me I understand the problems with scaling to different resolutions and how to tackle them as well as memory efficiency and allocation. I am better at everything UI related because of them and it has put me in good stead when going to Luminous later. This knowledge was invaluable and the principles they outlined for me to get pixel perfect designs is something I have taken forward with me ever since. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a brief mention, as a part of my first major project, I ended up doing a lot of spatial UIs which offer their own challenges to all their above, but thanks to the incredible team I had behind me this transition was simplified but the knowledge is still retained and I will be forever thankful to them for the incredible things they showed me. It made me a better developer and it made me appreciate how much work and effort goes into a 'good' UI design from the visuals to the performance.
