        <h1>Web</h1>
        <p>I have done web based work throughout my life for various portfolios and things but I have been using it most
          recently for projects involving SQL databases. One is a magic mirror website that runs on a Raspberry Pi that I
          eventually hope to get working with 'Alexa' from Amazon to update a local database for reminders/alerts. Another is a
          simple database entry and search program that I include because it runs using an Azure SQL Server as well as
          simple websites for friends/family.

        <h1>Magic Mirror</h1>
        <p class = "regular">This is the project that first got me started with SQL. After eventually getting the SQL part working I
          ended up moving house and never continued it. I will be coming back to this soon in my spare time. I want a local SQL database
          hosted on the Pi to be updated based on commands issued to a hidden Amazon Dot. This will then be reflected using Ajax
          on a local website stored on the Pi that will be displayed behind a two-way mirror creating the illusion of a GUI to your reflection.
          This is something I want to tinker with and improve every so often.

          He wants a simple data entry system that will allow his workers to update or search a database for tools. I have
          included some simple example entries. Feel free to add your own entry.

        <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
        <p>I thought I would include bootstrap here because it shows that I'm aware of the challenges faced with creating websites
          or sprites that are dynamic in nature and suitable for multiple platforms. If you would like to resize your browser on this page
          you will find the website changing as it hits the individual breakpoints. Everywhere else on the site I've tried to make this
          feature work seamlessly.
